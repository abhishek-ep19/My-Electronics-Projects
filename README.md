# Student Researched And Developed(SRAD) RF Transceiver
This is a project on design of a SRAD RF Transceiver which was made as a part of avionics team,Sounding Rocket, IIT Madras. This was designed using nRF905 RFIC and uses SPI AND I2C protocol. It operates on frequency 433 MHz which is operable in United States. Due to its low frequency we would be able to use an optimal length of antenna for communication at large distances and 10000 ft. at which rocket will attain its maximum height is well in its range above the ground.
